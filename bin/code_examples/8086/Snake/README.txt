Compile the game and you will get a .COM file.

This .COM file can be run in MS-DOS, you can also use emulators such as
DOSBOX to run this file.

If you do decide to use DOSBOX simply run the command "mount C: ADDRESS_TO_DIRECTORY"
replacing ADDRESS_TO_DIRECTORY with the directory of the executable.

Now enter "C:" this will take you to the DOSBOX C: drive that you just mounted
now type the executable name and press enter.
