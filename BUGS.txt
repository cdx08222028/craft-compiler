What happens: On the side with non even attributes only one "SPUSH" instruction is generated. 
Immediatley after a "SADD" instruction is generated this leads to problems as when the interperter pops a value from the stack,
you cannot be sure it is zero. Leading to an invalid result and possibly a program breaking.

Example:
; Below here is wrong. No first attribute is pushed to a stack
SPUSH 18
SADD

; Below here is fine
SPUSH 3 
SPUSH 10
SADD
